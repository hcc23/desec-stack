Welcome to the deSEC DNS API
============================

The deSEC DNS API is a REST interface that allows easy management of DNS
information.  The interface design aims for simplicity so that tasks such as
creating domains and manipulating DNS records can be handled with ease and in
an intuitive fashion.

Server-side operations, such as creation of domains or DNS records, expect
JSON-formatted user input in the body of the ``POST``, ``PATCH``, or ``PUT``
request (see below).  The request is required to come with a ``Content-Type:
application/json`` header field.

API functionality is demonstrated using the command line tool ``curl``.  To
pretty-print JSON output, process the data through ``jq``:  ``curl ... | jq .``.

**Windows users:** We are told that the `curl` commands in this documentation
sometimes do not work. In this case, try moving the request payload in front
of the `curl` call, like this::

    echo {"email": "mail@example.com", "password": "foobar"} | curl -X POST https://desec.io/api/v1/auth/login/ --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data @-
